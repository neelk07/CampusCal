CampusCal
=========
CampusCal is an event discovery website which allows users to navigate and search for events that they might be interested in. This includes a comphrensive map view as well as search features. Users can search by category, keywords, date, or a combination of them all. Events are either scraped from local venues or crowdsourced. Upon initial facebook login, the facebook profile is analyzed to determine the preferences of the user, to suggest better events. Visit the site at campuscal.herokuapp.com

Technologies
============
Django/Python, Facebook API, Web Scraping, Heroku 

What I Learned
==============
This project strengthened my django fundamental as well as taught me how to create and maintain a large database. I also had to think about who to make my queries more efficient to save time, and handle searching through the database. Working with retrieving facebook information with each user and analyzing it was also a challenge. 

Left To Do
==========
- work on frontend UI
- add more scraping sources
- filter out past events
- create better facebook profile analysis algorithm
- log search queries in database (provides for interesting data analysis)
